# Support Vector Regression

In this project I will do a regression using the Support Vector Machine algorithm.
In machine learning, support-vector machines (SVMs, also support-vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis.
SVMs are one of the most robust prediction methods, being based on statistical learning frameworks.
The objective of the support vector machine algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space(N â€” the number of features) that distinctly classifies the data points.
To separate the two classes of data points, there are many possible hyperplanes that could be chosen. Our objective is to find a plane that has the maximum margin, i.e the maximum distance between data points of both classes. Maximizing the margin distance provides some reinforcement so that future data points can be classified with more confidence.

# Dataset 
the dataset i use is a list of car prices in india.
consists of 12 columns and 5953 rows. the following is an explanation of each column:
Name: name of car

Location: located in india

Year: production year

Kilometers_Driven: how many kilometers have car traveled

Fuel_Type: type of fuel 

Owner_Type: new car or used

Transmission: manual or automatic

Mileage_kmpl: how far the car goes in 1 liter

Engine_cc: engine cc

Power_bhp: power 

Seats: how many seat

Price: the price i predict
